1. Which register number is used for the stack pointer (sp) in OS/161? $29
2. What bus/busses does OS/161 support? LAMEbus
3. What is the difference between splhigh and spl0? spl is the idea of allowing lower level interrupts to not impede the program while high level interrupts halt the program. splhigh() = sets spl to the highest value, disabling all interrupts.
spl0() = sets spl to 0, enabling all interrupts.
4. Why do we use typedefs like u_int32_t instead of simply saying "int"? So we clearly declare that we are using an unsigned int of size 32-bit rather than vaguely declaring int which can cause the gcc compiler to get upset.
5. What does splx return? the old interrupt state
6. What is the highest interrupt level? 15
7. How frequently are hardclock interrupts generated? HZ times a second, so if HZ=100, 100 times a second
8. What functions comprise the standard interface to a VFS device? d_open, d_close, d_io, d_ioctl
9. How many characters are allowed in a volume name? 32
10. How many direct blocks does an SFS file have? 15
11. What is the standard interface to a file system (i.e., what functions must you implement to 
implement a new file system)? fs_sync, fs_getvolname, fs_getroot, fs_unmount
12. What function puts a thread to sleep? void thread_sleep(const void *addr)
13. How large are OS/161 pids? int32_t, so 32 bits
14. What operations can you do on a vnode? vop_open, vop_clone, vop_reclaim, vop_read, vop_readlink, vop_getdirentry, vop_write, vop_ioctl, vop_stat, vop_gettype, vop_tryseek, vop_fsync, vop_mmap, vop_truncate, vop_namefile, vop_creat, vop_symlink, vop_mkdir, vop_link, vop_remove, vop_rmdir, vop_rename, vop_lookup, vop_lookparent
15. What is the maximum path length in OS/161? 1024
16. What is the system call number for a reboot? 8
17. Where is STDIN_FILENO defined? /home/u2/rrp0019/cs161/src/kern/include/kern/unistd.h defined to be 0
18. Is it OK to initialize the thread system before the scheduler? Why or why not? Yes, because the scheduler creates the run queue whereas the thread system just creates the first thread.
19. What is a zombie? Zombies are threads/processes that have exited but not been fully deleted yet.
20. How large is the initial run queue? runqueue = q_create(32); 32 
21. What does a device name in OS/161 look like? The name of a device is always just "device:". The VFS layer puts in the device name for us, so we don't need to do anything further.
22. What does a raw device name in OS/161 look like? name with "raw" attached to the end. EX lhd0, so raw device is lhd0raw
23. What lock protects the vnode reference count? vnode-countlock
24. What device types are currently supported? block device and character device.
